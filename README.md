# mpgdata

This is an ongoing project where I analyze the MPG data for my car and moped

**Files in this repository:**

*moped_mpg_data.csv* - .csv that stores miles, dollars and gallons of each moped fill up as well as date 

*car_mpg_data.csv* - .csv that stores miles, dollars and gallons of each car fill up as well as date 

*mpg_data.ipynb* - notebook that creates new columns in pandas dataframes for analysis. Exports the following three .csvs each time notebook is run (will overwrite)

*clean_m_data.csv* - .csv that stores moped data to visualize

*clean_c_data.csv* - .csv that stores car data to visualize

*clean_all_data.csv* - .csv that stores data in clean_m_data.csv and clean_c_data.csv, has extra column to differentiate which vehicle fill up was for

*mpgdatavis.twb* - tableau workbook where I visualize all data and create a dashboard

*mpg_vis.ipynb* - notebook where I visualize data with matplotlib/seaborn and other python packages

**TODO:**

* create a tableau dashboard and link in readme

* learn about representing irregular spaced time series data in matplotlib
